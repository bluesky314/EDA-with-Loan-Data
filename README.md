# EDA with Loan Data
Analysing loan data and plotting many plots to measure how different population segments do with returning loans. Segments analysed included different Occupations, Credit Ratings, States and Incomes. The large dataset provided me with ample data to make certain conclusions about which metric can be used as approximate predictors of loan success. Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate plots were made to analyse different relationships and three plots were chosen for final analysis. Used various R functions to subset the data and different plotting techniques to visualise multi-dimensional data. Finally presented as a report in R Markdown.
